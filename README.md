# Checkers
Fundamentals of Software Engineering Project

University of Verona, Italy - Master in Computer Game Development

In this project we have implemented the rules of Italian checkers. 
- Numbers of Pieces: 24 (12 White and 12 Black)
- Size of Board: 8x8 - 64 Squares (32 White and 32 Black) 
- White always moves first
- Men move one square diagonally forward
- When men reaches the farthest row, become kings (placing another piece of the same colour on top)
- Kings can move one square diagonally forward or back
- Multiple Capturing: Men and King can capture more than one piece
- A player wins when he has succeeded in capturing all of his opponent's pieces.

Anyway, in file Utils.java it's also possible to change the size of board and the number of pieces on it.
